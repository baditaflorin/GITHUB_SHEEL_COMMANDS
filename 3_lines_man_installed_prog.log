11-       their privilege in manipulating cgroups, the cgroup manager accepts regular D-Bus requests only from tasks within its own process-id and user namespaces.  For tasks in private
12-       namespaces  (such  as containers), SCM-enhanced D-Bus calls are available.  Using these manually is not recommended.  Rather, each container is advised to run a cgproxy, which

9:DESCRIPTION
10-       cgproxy is the D-Bus proxy for cgmanager.  Since a process in a non-initial process-id or user namespace will refer to tasks, user-ids or group-ids which are wrong in the ini‐
11-       tial namespace, the proxy will send these as SCM credentials to the cgmanager, relying on the kernel to translate the identifiers.  In this way, programs and users in  a  con‐

10:DESCRIPTION
11-       When debconf has the 'escape' capability set, it will expect commands you send it to have backslashes and newlines escaped (as "\\" and "\n" respectively) and will in turn
12-       escape backslashes and newlines in its replies. This can be used, for example, to substitute multi-line strings into templates, or to get multi-line extended descriptions

12:DESCRIPTION
13-       pnmremap replaces the colors in an input image with those from a colormap you specify.  Where a color in the input is not in the colormap, you have three  choices:  1)  choose
14-       the closest color from the colormap; 2) choose the first color from the colormap; 3) use a color specified by a command option.  (In this latter case, if the color you specify
15-       is not in your color map, the output will not necessarily contain only colors from the colormap).

11-       wise it will be grayscale.  The angle is in degrees (floating point), measured counter-clockwise.  It can be negative, but it should be between -90 and 90.   Also,  for  rota‐
12-       tions greater than 45 degrees you may get better results if you first use pnmflip to do a 90 degree rotation and then pnmrotate less than 45 degrees back the other direction
-- pnmrotate  --
19:DESCRIPTION
20-       Reads a PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input, scales it by the specified factor or factors and produces a PGM or PPM image as output.  If the input file is in color (PPM), the out‐
21-       put will be too, otherwise it will be grayscale (PGM).  This is true even if the input is a black and white bitmap (PBM), because the process of scaling can turn a combination

11:DESCRIPTION
12-       Gzip reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension .gz, while keeping the same owner‐
13-       ship modes, access and modification times.  (The default extension is -gz for VMS, z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if  a  file
14-       name is "-", the standard input is compressed to the standard output.  Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it will ignore symbolic links.

10-       zforce  forces  a .gz extension on all gzip files so that gzip will not compress them twice.  This can be useful for files with names truncated after a file transfer.  On sys‐
11-       tems with a 14 char limitation on file names, the original name is truncated to make room for the .gz suffix. For example, 12345678901234 is renamed to 12345678901.gz. A  file
12-       name such as foo.tgz is left intact.

11:DESCRIPTION
12-       zipinfo lists technical information about files in a ZIP archive, most commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  Such information includes file access permissions, encryption status,
13-       type of compression, version and operating system or file system of compressing program, and the like.  The default behavior (with no options) is to list  single-line  entries
14-       for  each  file  in  the archive, with header and trailer lines providing summary information for the entire archive.  The format is a cross between Unix ``ls -l'' and ``unzip
15:       -v'' output.  See DETAILED DESCRIPTION below.  Note that zipinfo is the same program as unzip (under Unix, a link to it); on some systems, however, zipinfo  support  may  have
16-       been omitted when unzip was compiled.
